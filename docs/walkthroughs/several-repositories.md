# Look after several repositories

Tidewater is three repositories: the dashboard, `harbour-api` and `tide-tables`. Each morning Leo wants to know which of them have changes he hasn't pulled, and which have work he hasn't committed, without opening each one.

## Make a group

1. Go to the start page: click the flag at the top left, or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>.
2. Click **New group** and name it.
3. Click **Add…** under the group and choose each repository's folder.

## Use the dashboard

Click **Dashboard** under the group. It shows every repository in the group on one screen:

| Column | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Branch** | The branch checked out. |
| **Sync** | How far ahead (↑) or behind (↓) its upstream it is, or *up to date*. |
| **Changes** | How many files have uncommitted changes, or *clean*. |
| **Last fetch** | When it last heard from its remote. |

- **Fetch all** fetches every repository in the group.
- **Pull all** pulls them, fast-forward only. A repository whose branch has diverged from its upstream is reported and left alone, never merged, so a batch pull can't surprise you.
- **Open** opens one repository in a tab; **Open all as tabs** opens the lot.

## Good to know

- **Groups are only a list.** Removing a repository from a group, or deleting the group, doesn't touch the repositories.
- **Worktrees** are the other way to work on several things at once: two branches of the same repository, checked out side by side in different folders. **Manage worktrees…** in the command palette sets them up. See [Repositories and tabs](../guide/repositories.md#worktrees).
