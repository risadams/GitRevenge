# Branch care

Repositories pile up branches: release branches, a `gh-pages` site, dozens of `dependabot/…` branches, work stacked on other work, and branches whose pull requests merged weeks ago. This page covers the tools for keeping that tidy.

Everything here is set per repository and kept on your computer, in Git Revenge's own settings. Nothing is written into the repository, so it never changes what anyone else sees. Open **Settings** with a repository's tab active and look under **This repository**.

## Branch kinds

Some branches aren't like the others. Git Revenge knows five **kinds**, and treats each one in its own way:

| Kind | Default patterns | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| **Trunk** | `main`, `master`, `develop`, `trunk` | Pinned to the left of the graph as a straight spine. Its chip is bold. |
| **Release** | `release/*`, `releases/*`, `hotfix/*` | Its own sidebar section, newest version first. Can bound an Insights releases window. |
| **Environment** | none | For deploy branches such as `staging` or `production`. Its own sidebar section. |
| **Docs** | `gh-pages`, `gh-docs`, `docs-site` | Drawn muted in the graph, with a toggle to hide it. Left out of Insights. |
| **Bot** | `dependabot/*`, `renovate/*` | A collapsed sidebar section, with a toggle to hide it. Grouped as dependency updates in Insights. |

A pattern matches the branch name without its remote, so `release/*` covers `release/1.4` and `origin/release/1.4` alike. A `*` matches anything, slashes included, so `dependabot/*` catches `dependabot/npm_and_yarn/vite-7.1`. The first kind that matches wins, in the order of the table.

### Changing them

- **One branch:** right-click it and choose **Mark as…**, then pick a kind or **Ordinary branch**. If a wider pattern still claims the branch (`release/2.0` under `release/*`, say), you're told which one to change.
- **Patterns:** in Settings, under **This repository**, each kind has a field. Separate patterns with commas or spaces. **Use defaults** puts a kind back.

### How kinds look

- **Graph chips** take the kind's colour and icon: Trunk in rose and bold, Release in plum, Environment in ochre, Docs as a teal outline, Bot in faint, smaller text.
- **The timeline** shows the kind's icon in a commit's circle, instead of the author's initials, for commits on Release, Environment, Docs and Bot lines.
- **Docs lines** are drawn faded, with their commit messages muted, since a published site isn't code.
- **The sidebar** splits your local branches into **Trunk** (at the top), **Branches**, **Releases**, **Environments**, **Docs** and **Bots** (collapsed). A section only appears when it has branches. Remote branches stay together under **Remotes**, each marked with its kind's icon.

The design behind kinds is [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-branch-kinds.md).

## Hiding branches

Hidden branches leave the sidebar and the graph. Commits that only they reach disappear from the graph too, though the branch you have checked out always stays.

- **One branch:** right-click it and choose **Hide**. Hiding `wip/x` hides `origin/wip/x` too.
- **Patterns:** under **This repository** in Settings, list them in **Hidden branches**, such as `wip/*, archive/*`.
- **Docs and Bots:** the **Docs** and **Bots** buttons in the graph's header show or hide every branch of that kind. They're on (showing) by default, and appear once the repository has branches of that kind.

When something is hidden, the sidebar says how many, under the branch lists. **Show them** brings them back for now, marked *hidden*; **Hide them again** undoes that. To unhide a branch for good, right-click it while it's showing and choose **Unhide**.

## Cleaning up merged branches

Turn on **Clean up merged branches after each pull** under **This repository**. After each pull, Git Revenge then deletes local branches that meet all of these:

- the branch's upstream was deleted on the remote, as hosts do after a pull request merges;
- the branch has nothing that wasn't pushed: it sits exactly where its upstream last was;
- it isn't the branch you have checked out, or one checked out in a worktree;
- it isn't a Trunk, Release, Environment or Docs branch;
- no other branch is [stacked](#stacked-branches) on it.

This works with squash merges, which `git branch --merged` can't detect. Git Revenge remembers where each upstream was every time you fetch or pull, so a fetch that clears away a deleted upstream doesn't hide the evidence from the pull that follows. A branch whose upstream disappeared before you opened the app is left alone.

A message in the corner names what was deleted. **Undo** in it, or the toolbar's Undo, brings every one of them back.

## Syncing notes

[Git notes](history.md#notes) aren't fetched or pushed by default. Turn on **Sync notes on fetch, pull and push** under **This repository** to change that:

- **Fetch and pull** bring in the remote's notes, and your notes catch up with them.
- **Push** sends your notes along with the branch. It never forces: if the remote has notes you don't, the push of the notes is refused, and you're told.
- **When both sides wrote notes the other doesn't have**, they've diverged. Git Revenge leaves yours as they are and says so; merge them with `git notes merge`, then push.

A problem with notes never stops the fetch, pull or push itself.

## Stacked branches

A branch is **stacked** when it builds on another branch that hasn't merged yet: you started `feature/b` from `feature/a` to keep going while `feature/a` waits for review.

Git Revenge works this out from history. In the sidebar, a stacked branch sits under the branch it builds on, indented, with its place in the stack (**2 of 3**). Hover over that to see what it's stacked on. In the graph, its chip carries a small stack mark.

If the guess is wrong, right-click the branch and choose **Stacked on…**: pick the right branch, **Not stacked**, or **Detect automatically** to go back to the guess.

### Restacking after the branch below merges

When a host squash-merges the branch below, the branch on top still carries the old, un-squashed commits. Once a fetch or pull shows the lower branch's upstream is gone, the branch on top is marked **parent merged** in the sidebar.

Right-click it and choose **Restack**. Git Revenge checks it out if it isn't already, then moves just its own commits onto the latest Trunk, leaving the merged branch's old commits behind. If that runs into conflicts, you resolve them as in any [rebase](branches.md#conflicts). Undo puts the branch back where it was.

## Safety checks

Some kinds deserve a second thought before something drastic happens to them:

| Action | Asks first for |
|---|---|
| Force push | Trunk, Release and Environment branches |
| Delete a local branch | Trunk and Environment branches name their kind in the confirmation |
| Delete a branch from a remote | Trunk and Environment branches; others go at once |

## In Insights

[Insights](insights.md) uses kinds too. Docs and Release branches are left out of **Needs attention** and its trial merges, since they're expected to drift from the target. Dependency updates from bots are grouped on their own in **Shipped**. Release branches can mark the ends of a releases window. The kind patterns in use are printed with every export, because they change the results.
