# Changes and commits

Click **Uncommitted changes** at the top of the graph (or choose **Show uncommitted changes** in the command palette) to see what's changed in your working tree.

## Staging

- **Stage all** and **Unstage all** move everything at once.
- Each file has its own stage and discard buttons.
- Open a file to stage part of it. In the **Unified** diff, each hunk has a **Stage hunk** button, and you can select individual lines and stage just those. Staged changes can be unstaged the same way.

Discarding asks you to confirm first, since it throws your changes away.

## Committing

Write a **Summary** (required) and, if you like, a longer **Description**. Keep the summary under about 72 characters; the app warns you when it's longer. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to commit.

You can also amend the last commit.

If your git config signs commits (`commit.gpgsign`), commits made in Git Revenge are signed too, with GPG or SSH as your config says.

## Stashing

**Stash** sets your uncommitted changes aside; **Stash…** lets you give the stash a message first. Stashes are listed in the sidebar. Right-click one to **Apply**, **Pop** or **Drop** it.

## Undo and redo

Commits, checkouts, merges, cherry-picks, rebases, resets, reverts and pulls can be undone. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to undo and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to redo. The command palette names what the next undo will reverse, such as *Undo: Commit "Fix the login form"*.

Undo is only offered while the repository is exactly where that operation left it. If anything has moved since, whether in the app or in a terminal, it refuses rather than guess. Nothing is lost either way: the [reflog](history.md#the-reflog) keeps every earlier state.
